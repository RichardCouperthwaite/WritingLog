# WritingLog
Writing log app for android

This code was written in Android Studio. 

This application is intended to be used for as a writing log for the purposes of the D3EM program writing techniques.

Application allows the user to create projects, each with a title, description and due date. Writing sessions are then started from these projects. The application automatically times the writing session and when the session is ended records the start time, end time and duration of the session along with comments from the user to guide the work for the next writing session.

A "Just Write!" option allows the user to just write without writing for a specific project. The session data is still recorded in the writing log

A writing statistics section allows the user to see how much writing has been done in weekly and monthly periods. The statistics show the current and previous periods and the time, and days spent writing.

This application is quite general and could be used to track time spent on any kind of project, not just writing projects.
