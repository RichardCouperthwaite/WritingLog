public class FileIO {
//This class needs to have methods that can handle input and output to three files
//The three files are:
//1) projectlist file (JSON)
//2) stats file (JSON)
//3) alldata file (csv)
//
//The projectlist file will contain a list of all projects that have a structure the same
//and the Project class. The input and ouput for this file needs to send back a list of all the
//projects
//
//the stats file will contain the data for the current and previous weeks and month. Will need to
//be able to input and output data to this file as sessions are completed. only need to get the data
//when the stats tab is opened.
//
//The alldata file needs to be a csv type file (for easy export) that records every session in terms
//of start time, end time, date, project, and final comment. could also consider a comment on how the
//session went. This will just record all data at the end of each session and add a new line to the end
//of the file. No output from this file will be necessary at this time.
